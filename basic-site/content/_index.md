**We use thinking-boxes and a lot of numbers to learn about where animals and green things live, and what they eat.**

Our research on how complex ecological systems function, change, and evolve,
relies on simulations, mathematics, and machine learning. We have a specific
interest in ecological networks, biogeography, and epidemics. We believe in open
science, in ecological synthesis based on open data, and in actionable
fundamental research.
